Copying 2-D array in python

Today i learned how to copy 2-D array in python. I had an array of strings which i needed to copy into another array.

I looked for how 2D arrays are copied in python and found the solution is to use the copy module.

I added the line, from copy import copy, deepcopy

then i copied the array as,  copied_array_name = deepcopy(original_array_name)
