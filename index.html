Hello, world

I recently read that it is possible to create a website using github. I learned how to do so using this link -<A href="https://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/start/new-project/user-page/" target="_blank">Create your own website"</A>.

<br>
<br>
<p>Today i watched a video called 'Think Audacious'. It was from the Apple developer conference. It was a talk delivered by the founder, Debbie Sterling, of the interactive toy company, GoldieBlox.</p>

<p>Her story strengthened the fact that perseverance is the key to success. We need to ignore our critics and believe in ourselves to go beyond our limits to achieve our goal. </p>

  Quotes -
  <ul>
    “If you always put limits on everything you do, physical or anything else, it will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.” -Bruce Lee
  </ul>

    "Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow". -Ralph Waldo Emerson

    "A ship is safe in harbor, but that's not what ships are for." -William Shedd
  </ul>
  
  <ul>
    “Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.” 
― H. Jackson Brown Jr., P.S. I Love You
  </ul>
  
  <ul>
    “Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don't think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn't stop you from doing anything at all.” 
― Richard Feynman
  </ul>
  
  <ul>
“Be curious. Read widely. Try new things. What people call intelligence just boils down to curiosity.” 
― Aaron Swartz
  </ul>
  
  <ul>
    “I wish it need not have happened in my time," said Frodo.
"So do I," said Gandalf, "and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.” 
― J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring

    “It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”

<p>I read one of the <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-one-piece-of-advice-you-would-like-to-give-to-students/answer/Andrew-Ng">Andrew Ng's answer</a> on Quora about his advice to students and i found it very motivating.</p>

<p>
  When deciding how to spend your time, I recommend you take into account two criteria:
Whether what you're doing can change the world.
How much you'll learn.
Even today, this is how I decide how to spend my time.
Our society today is incredibly good at giving individuals the opportunities to change the world. With digital technology and modern communications, ideas and products can spread faster than ever before. With the right ideas and strong execution, any person can quickly help a lot of others on our planet.
So, ask yourself: If what you're working on succeeds beyond your wildest dreams, would you have significantly helped other people? If not, then keep searching for something else to work on. Otherwise you're not living up to your full potential. 
Second, especially when you're young, don't estimate the value of investing in your own future education.
My definition of "young" is anyone less than 100 years old.
Anything you learn will pay off for decades to come. But it won't be easy. Once you're out of school, investing time in learning has relatively few short-term rewards. There's no teacher standing over your shoulder to give you a grade or motivate you to keep studying. But if you can inspire yourself or make it fun to keep reading, keep playing with ideas, keep talking to people that you can learn from, then over a span of years you can become incredibly talented in your areas of study.
For myself, I love reading. I have >1000 books on my kindle, and spend a lot of time in the evenings and weekends reading. My reading diet includes academic research papers, books on business strategy, the innovation process, products, biographies of people I admire, and more. I sometimes take MOOCs. I also love talking to people who can teach me new things, whether an old friend or a new acquaintance.
The process of learning will also help you decide what to work on. When you've seen enough examples of what others are doing to change the world, you'll also get more and more ideas for how you can change the world yourself. 
To summarize: Keep investing in your own learning, even when it's hard. And keep searching for a way to contribute to something that helps humanity!
