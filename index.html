Hello, world

I recently read that it is possible to create a website using github. I learned how to do so using this link -<A href="https://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/start/new-project/user-page/" target="_blank">Create your own website"</A>.

<br>
<br>
<p>Today i watched a video called 'Think Audacious'. It was from the Apple developer conference. It was a talk delivered by the founder, Debbie Sterling, of the interactive toy company, GoldieBlox.</p>

<p>Her story strengthened the fact that perseverance is the key to success. We need to ignore our critics and believe in ourselves to go beyond our limits to achieve our goal. </p>
